#### Hi 👋, This is Rakesh Bangla. I’m a former digital marketer who has found a new passion in working with data.

👨🏽‍💻  **My Journey into Data Analytics:**

While I was working as a Digital Marketer, I went through some business scenarios where the Leads for the company were coming down. I was questioning the reasons for the decrease in leads, and also my team lead gave me this job to find out the actual reasons. This is when I got interested in analyzing businesses and data and came to know my new passion for analyzing/questioning things and coming up with solutions. This situation encouraged me to look for an exciting career in Data.   

For the love and passion of analysing businesses and data, I have recently taken up Data Analytics course at codebasics.io. With the skills and concepts I have learned (and learning), I’m building some real-time analytics projects for business use cases. In the mean while, I’m looking forward for a career transition into the Data Analytics/Data Science domain where I can use my recently acquired data skills to help solve business problems and help businesses grow.

🌟  **What I Love doing:**   

• An innate interest for thinking of ‘Why’, ‘How’, and ‘What’ for the given scenario and coming up with relevant solutions

• I love analysing data and business processes to come up with useful insights and recommendations which can help the business to grow

• I love creating and building something new which can produce business value
